The data was exported from my runkeeper profile.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#reading for data in to a DataFrame\r\ndf = pd.read_csv('cardioActivities.csv')\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Some aggregated stats about running and walking \r\n```\r\n\r\n    Number of total activities  312\r\n    Total distance  754.53  km\r\n    Total Calories burned  52214  Cal\r\n    Average distance per activity  2.45  km\r\n    Average Calories burned per activity  167  Cal\r\n    --------------------------------------------------\r\n    Number of walking  activities  222\r\n    Total distance in walking  383.25  km\r\n    Average distance per walking activity  1.72635135135  km\r\n    Average Calories burned per walking activity  109  Cal\r\n    --------------------------------------------------\r\n    Number of running activities  90\r\n    Total distance in running  371.28  km\r\n    Average distance per running activity  4.12533333333  km\r\n    Average Calories burned per running activity  308  Cal\r\n    --------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Monthly walking distance and calories burned for 4 years. Looks like I have ran more often during this year. \r\n<img src=\"images/output_3_0.png\" alt=\"hi\" class=\"inline\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Monthly running distances and calories burned for 4 years. \r\n![png](output_4_0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Yearly walking distances and calories burned for 4 years. \r\n\r\n![png](output_5_0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Yearly running distances and calories burned for 4 years. \r\n\r\n![png](output_6_0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Average speed per activity during this year(2016). Average speed per activity is calculated by dividing the total distance in each activity by the duration it took to complete the activity.  \r\n![png](output_7_0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Average pace per activity during this year(2016). Average pace is average number of minutes takes to complete each kilometer in an activity\r\n\r\n\r\n![png](output_8_0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Correlation between distance and duration for all walking activities. It can be seen that there is high correlation as it is very likely that longer I walk, more distance I cover.\r\n\r\n![png](output_9_0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Correlation between distance and duration for all running activities. We can see good correlation but not as strongly like in walking. It is because longer I run, more difficult it might become to maintain the speed and hence the distance. \r\n![png](output_11_0.png)\r\n",
